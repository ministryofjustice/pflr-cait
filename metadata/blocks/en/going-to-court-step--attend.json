  "body": "At the first hearing the judge will see if there’s still a chance you can reach an agreement with the other parent. \r\n\r\n### If you can reach an agreement\r\n\r\nThe judge will end the process and write a consent order setting out the details of your agreement.\r\n\r\n### If you can’t reach an agreement\r\n\r\nIf the court makes an order it will be based on what is best for your child.\r\n\r\nYour case may be put on hold (adjourned) if the judge needs more information or time to decide what’s best for your children. The judge may ask Cafcass to write another report.\r\n\r\nA new date is set for the next hearing. If you reach an agreement before this date you’ll need to go back to court for a judge to make a consent order.\r\n\r\nGOV.UK has more information on [what happens if there’s no agreement at the first hearing](https://www.gov.uk/looking-after-children-divorce/after-you-apply-for-a-court-order).",
